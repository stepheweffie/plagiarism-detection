                "description": "Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Dennis McKenna discuss the science behind psychedelics, the entities found through the looking glass, the current pharmaceutical approach to long life, and why it needs to change.\n\nDr. Dennis McKenna is an American ethnopharmacologist, lecturer and author. He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit exploring the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. McKenna received his masters in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979, followed by his doctorate in the same field at the University of British Columbia in 1984. Dennis is the brother of Terrence McKenna, a cultural figure and proponent for the exploration of psychedelics. Together they co-authored The Invisible Landscape. Much later McKenna would write a memoir, Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss,  detailing he and his brothers exploits in the field. Today, Dennis tours and lectures, while also running the  McKenna Academy of Natural Philosophy, which seeks to uncover the mysteries of consciousness held within the realm of botany and pharmacology.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nMcKenna Academy: https://mckenna.academy\n\nThe Experiment at La Chorrera https://mckenna.academy/events?id=32 \n\nESPD55 Livestream Symposium ESPD55.com\n\nThose interested in donations may contact connect@mckenna.academy\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\n\nBirch Gold - Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\nElysium Health - Save 25% off Basis monthly subscriptions with code JBP25: https://trybasis.com/Jordan\n\nShopify - Get a FREE 14-day trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:40) intro\n(2:33) Dr. Dennis McKenna now\n(6:47) What is ethnopharmacology?\n(12:45) Ayahuasca\n(26:02) Hierarchy of concepts\n(30:00) The Reality Hallucination\n(43:50) Breaking down hyper reality \n(49:30) Commonalities of entities\n(55:50) The intrinsic form of personality\n(1:00:15) Ritual, bad shamans\n(1:02:58) Carl Rogers, voluntary exposure\n(1:09:15) Roland Griffiths, the flaw in how medicine is practiced\n(1:12:05) Impending mortality\n(1:24:45) Dr. McKenna\u2019s future plans\n(1:26:19) Looking back at a life long career \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #DennisMcKenna #psychedelics #science #drugs",

                "description": "Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\nChristopher Rufo cast himself into the middle of controversy as he sought to bring light to the inner workings of American academia, and more specifically, how our institutions have begun to funnel in a new and ultimately detrimental worldview, critical race theory. He sits down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the subject, delving into the true threat that has breached thousands of publicly funded schools.\n\nRufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Before this he was a visiting fellow for domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, as well as a Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute, and a research fellow at the Discovery Institute of Washington. In his early career, he worked in the documentary filmmaking field, where he saw first hand how impoverished communities in the United States operate, and more appropriately continue to struggle under a cycle of seemingly inescapable destitution.\n\nHe is the author of two books, \u201cNo Way Home: The Crisis of Homelessness,\u201d and \u201cHow to Fix It with Intelligence and Humanity.\u201d Today he publishes a show dedicated to these topics on his YouTube channel, \u201cChristopher Rufo Theory.\"\n\nChristopher Rufo's early experiences led him to publicly stand against the rapidly growing movement we see today to teach Critical Race Theory in schools, focusing mainly on K through 12. He argues that CRT looms as \u201can existential threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nWatch Christopher Rufo on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/christopherrufo\n\nVisit the Manhattan Institute: https://www.manhattan-institute.org/expert/christopher-f-rufo\n\nMore on Critical Race Theory: https://christopherrufo.com/crt-briefing-book/\n\nThis video is sponsored by Birch Gold.

                "description": "Yeonmi Park's account of her experience at Columbia University is harrowing - as someone who had just arrived in the West after her escape from North Korea, the idea that she had to censor herself at a prestigious university like Columbia, or any university for that matter -  which have historically been bastions of free thought is horrifying. Her experience serves as one example of just how far the Universities have deteriorated.\n\n#Universities #UofColumbia #ColumbiaUniversity\n\nDr Peterson wanted to put this together because he still feels like it\u2019s possible to save the Universities, but before that can happen, more people need to be aware of just how twisted they\u2019ve become.

It has become apparent that an anti-racism curriculum is being instituted in schools across the United States and that doesn\u2019t initially sound like anything but a positive change. I had Paul on to share his concerns after working in one of these schools that are implementing new ways of thinking about how our western society is structured. We spoke about many of the flaws that we see with the current direction of teaching.\n\nPaul Rossi is a high school mathematics teacher and writer. His April 21st, 2021 essay titled \u201cI Refuse to Stand by While my Students are Indoctrinated\u201d was published on Bari Weiss\u2019 Substack \u201cCommon Sense with Bari Weiss\u201d.

                "description": "This episode was recorded on October 11th, 2021.\n\nDr. Arif Ahmed and Dr. James Orr come on to discuss what led to the University of Cambridge rescinding my invitation to speak there. We get into the difficulty of change in universities, anonymous reporting, the dangers of limiting free speech, microaggressions, the importance of humor, and more.\n\nArif Ahmed MBE is a philosopher, lecturer at Cambridge, and author of \u201cSaul Kripke\u201d. His interests include decision theory and religion from an atheist and libertarian point of view. In the aftermath of the Cambridge incident, Dr. Ahmed remained a vocal advocate for political diversity. \n\nDr. James Orr is a university lecturer in philosophy of religion at Cambridge and author of \u201cThe Mind of God and the Works of Nature.\u201d He is a regular contributor to The Times Literary Supplement and The Critic.\n\nDr. Ahmed\u2019s profile:\nhttps://phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed\n\n\u201cSaul Kripke\u201d:\nhttps://amazon.com/Kripke-Bloomsbury-Contemporary-American-Thinkers/dp/0826492622\n\nDr. Orr\u2019s profile:\nhttps://divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-james-orr\n\n\u201cThe Mind of God and Works of Nature\u201d:\nhttps://amazon.co.uk/Mind-God-Works-Nature-Philosophical/dp/9042937629\n\n_______________\nTimestamps \n_______________\n[00:00] Intro \n[01:13] The Cambridge repeal\n[09:41] A case for the repealers, their potential fears\n[10:19] Photos \u201cdon\u2019t imply a position\u2014that was one of the most outrageous things, \u2018endorsement by association\u2026\u2019 As if standing next to someone implies [you\u2019re in agreement]\" - Dr. Ahmed\n[14:11]  Changes in free speech policy \n[19:54] Speaking Up: Consequences\n[25:28] The difficulty of change in university\n[27:36] \u201cYou become what you practice\u201d - Jordan Peterson\n[27:45] \u201cIf you put off fights, they don't usually get better\u201d - Jordan Peterson\n[35:53] Being Silent: Perils\n[36:04] \u201cIn general, with any coercive principle, think what might happen in the hands of someone wicked and tyrannical. That's how we should think about these things\u201d - Dr. Ahmed\n[41:46] \"The idea that you should remove everything that could threaten someone's identity and you should make that a university-wide policy is actually, exactly the opposite of what you should do, speaking clinically if you're trying to help people become more resilient\" - Dr. Peterson\n[44:32] Microaggressions and the importance of humor\n[44:33] \"There\u2019s no such thing as a joke that isn't a microaggression. Jokes aren't funny unless they're microaggressions\u2013especially witty ones\" - Dr. Peterson\n[47:19] Anonymous voting & reporting\n[49:52] \"Politics is downstream from culture [and, for better or worse,] culture is generated in universities\" - Dr. Peterson\n[49:59] \u201cWhat happens on campus doesn't stay on campus\" - Dr. Orr\n[50:50] \"The point about anonymous reporting is that... you can't come back to them to check their evidence. The person who has been accused can't face their accuser. There\u2019s no possibility of due process\u201d - Dr. Ahmed\n[54:51] Anonymous reports circumventing due process\n[57:55] Tyranny & Free Speech\n[59:17] Details about the vote; university bureaucracy\n[01:05:56] UK legislation post-Cambridge  \n[01:13:06] Anti-education & ideological purity tests at university\n[01:15:36] \"I've heard students say \u2018Well, I just write what the professor wants...\u2019 It's like no \u2013 writing is thinking and if you don't think, that becomes part of you \u2013 those words become part of you [and] that's not bad education, it's anti-education\" - Dr. Peterson\n\n#Education #Cambridge #Microaggressions #Ideology #FreeSpeech\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit: https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

                "description": "Ep. 351\n\nWatch Jordan Peterson's \"Vision & Destiny\" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nPeterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality \u2014 with a vision. \n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Naomi Wolf discuss her original ambitions, the derailment of her scholarly career at the hands of misogyny, her rise to the forefront of third wave feminism as a best-selling author, and how the mainstream turned on her once she wrote on a topic the Left had blacklisted: COVID-19.\n\nNaomi Wolf is an American author and journalist. Her first book, \u201cThe Beauty Myth,\u201d would challenge notions of attraction, arguing they are societally fabricated. This publication became an international bestseller and cemented Wolf as one of the leading spokeswomen for the third wave feminist movement. She has published many books since then, such as \u201cThe End of America, and Vagina: A New Biography.\u201d In recent years, she has come under fire for being an \u201canti-vaxer\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theorist,\u201d which led Wolf to write her most recent book, \u201cThe Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, COVID-19 and The War Against the Human.\u201d\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nElysium Health: Get 15% off sitewide!

                "description": "Ep. 367\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. James Lindsay break down how Marxism evolved from a singular ideology into a genus, spawning many oppressor/oppressed dogmas across modern culture such as equity, critical race theory, and queer theory. They trace these sub-Marxist doctrines back past fundamental narrative into the theological realm, and detail their utility in the acquisition of power. Dr. Peterson and Dr. Lindsay also discuss the Grievance Studies Affair, of which Dr. Lindsay was a co-author and which casts a spotlight on the Marxist capture of our academic and scientific institutions.\n\nAn author, mathematician, and political commentator, Dr. James Lindsay has written eight books spanning a range of subjects including education, postmodern theory, and critical race theory.

                "description": "Ep. 370\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Zach Lahn discuss the Wonder School, a Socratic-based education system in Wichita, Kansas. They delve into the value of learner-driven education, the origins of the American school system as a means to create obedient factory workers, and the true role of schools in shaping a child\u2019s character. They also walk through a day in the life of a Wonder Leaner, the curriculum designed to help inspire these students toward their true calling, and exactly why this unconventional approach might be well worth your consideration as a parent.\n\nZach Lahn is the co-founder of Wonder, a learner-driven school in Wichita, Kansas, with the mission of helping young people find their calling and preparing them to change the world. His background in business has been as a founder of a search fund focused on acquiring and building small to medium companies. Prior to founding Wonder, Zach managed U.S. Congressional and Senatorial campaigns and raised funds for startup companies and nonprofit organizations. He now spends nearly all of his time at school with his six kids and with his wife, building a regenerative farm on his family\u2019s ancestral homestead in Iowa.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n- Sponsor - \n\nPre-born: \u200b\u200bHelp save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Zach Lahn:\n\nTwitter @ZachLahn https://twitter.com/ZachLahn \n\nThe Wonder School www.daringtowonder.com/\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:27) Intro\n(1:15) The need for a new model\n(5:46) What is most important for children to learn?\n(6:57) Agency over skillset\n(9:45) Self Authoring\n(12:43) Origin of the American education system\n(15:44) competing systems\n(17:36) The Wonder schedule\n(21:28) Kids live in a meta narrative\n(22:23) The education of character\n(23:47) Akira the Don, active learning\n(27:36) Mixed age classes\n(30:20) Inspiring development and leadership\n(31:31) Necessary freedom\n(33:07) Socratic discussion, mentors\n(37:05) Khan Academy\n(39:20) Goals for kindergarten\n(40:04) Compared to public school\n(41:51) Tuition\n(43:20) The problem with measurement\n(44:30) Self tracking and public peer review\n(50:00) Two behaviors that cannot work in school\n(51:26) If not rectified by the age of 4\u2026\n(52:49) Gamified learning\n(54:03) Freedom hours\n(56:49) Are Wonder graduates prepared?\n(58:14) How conflicts are handled\n(1:01:13) All learning is self-learning\n(1:04:25) When initiative is scorned\n(1:07:54) How to determine what learners read\n(1:09:18) Why self help books are so useful\n(1:10:34) Why children don\u2019t like reading\n(1:12:17) Book review review\n(1:15:09) Badge plan\n(1:19:10) Aims of each age group\n(1:22:18) The power in apprenticeships\n(1:28:50) Approach to high school, the \u201cnext great adventure\u201d\n(1:32:05) Success of the model\n(1:34:03) Be ready for a journey\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

All of Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://www.dailywire.com/trial/jordan\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and twelve-time All-American female swimmer Riley Gaines discuss the insemination of men into women's spaces. Gaines breaks down the breach in security that women face when forced to share vulnerable spaces with biological men, the purpose of athletic achievement, why segregation of the sexes has genuine merit, and what exactly went down at San Francisco State University.\n\nRiley Gaines is an American athlete and female rights activist. Gaines is a graduate from the University of Kentucky, where she was a twelve-time All-American swimmer. She competed and tied with trans-identifying swimmer Lia Thomas at their NCAA championships and was unfairly sidelined from the awards ceremony. She has spoken to numerous teammates and administrators who do not think this attack on female sports is fair, and more importantly, do not feel this invasion by men into female spaces is remotely safe. Gaines has become an outspoken female rights activist, advocating for the protection of women's spaces, sports, and achievements, and has proven herself unshakable even when faced with a dangerous mob.\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nMoink: Get FREE bacon in your first Moink order today!\nhttp://www.MoinkBox.com/JBP\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Riley Gaines:\n\nWebsite: https://rileygaines.com/\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Riley_Gaines_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:24) Intro\n(2:25) Riley\u2019s credibility as an athlete\n(7:28) Obsessive dedication and unmatched discipline\n(11:49) Why ambition is not selfish\n(14:25) Grace in defeat\n(16:09) Lessons only sport can teach you\n(19:35 The necessary attributes of a team captain\n(21:47) Alignment of interest despite individual goals\n(23:23) Navigating leadership on an all female team\n(29:01) Masculine versus feminine mindset in sports\n(30:36) Why sports don\u2019t have radical equality\n(34:09) The purpose of high level competition\n(35:23) Should any domains be sex segregated?\n(42:33) What you give up for athletic success\n(48:28) Men in women\u2019s sports\n(53:22) Riley\u2019s first competition against Lea Thomas\n(1:04:56) The psychology of knowing you won\u2019t win even when you win\n(1:08:13) Derealization, and those who Lea Thomas has displaced\n(1:12:49) Lea Thomas is a narcissist\n(1:21:22) Invading the locker room, the failure of administrators\n(1:30:34) SFSU: the whole story of the viral incident\n(1:48:26) Riley Gaines will not back down\n(1:52:19) We must advocate for change\n\n\nEp.356\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #dailywireplus \n#TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

                "description": "Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott to discuss the inception of their new book, \u201cThe Canceling of the American Mind,\u201d which seeks to assess cancel culture as it harshly affects American universities and institutions. They also break down the differences between feminine and masculine tendencies in regards to free speech, the entirely real and yet rarely discussed toxic femininity, and why we must prioritize a cultural shift away from the ease of victimhood.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nGreg Lukianoff is a journalist, producer, attorney, New York Times bestselling author, and the president and CEO of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), which is the nation's leading defender of fundamental rights on college campuses. In 2022, FIRE announced they would expand their coverage to fundamental rights off-campus as well, and at this time added \u201cExpression\u201d to their name and mission statement.\n\nRikki Schlott is a New York City-based journalist and political commentator. She is a former research fellow at FIRE, host of the Lost Debate podcast, a columnist at the New York Post, and a regular contributor to numerous publications and television programs. Her commentary focuses on free speech, campus culture, civil liberties, and youth issues from a Generation Z perspective.\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\n\u201cThe Canceling of the American Mind\u201d (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Canceling-American-Mind-Undermines-Threatens/dp/1668019140/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KWJ4S9GF9BI0&keywords=the+cancelling+of+the+american+mind&qid=1697485877&sprefix=the+cancelling+of+the+american+mind%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-1 \n\nFor Greg Lukianoff:\n\nFIRE Website https://www.thefire.org/about-us/our-team/greg-lukianoff \nOn Twitter https://twitter.com/glukianoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/glukianoff/?hl=en \nOn Substack https://greglukianoff.substack.com/ \n\n\nFor Rikki Schlott:\n\nWebsite https://www.rikkischlott.com \nOn Twitter  https://twitter.com/rikkischlott\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/rikkischlott/\nOn Substack rikkischlott.substack.com\n\n\n- Chapters - \n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:17) Intro\n(1:06) The Cancelling of the American Mind\n(7:08) Mired in politics at younger and younger ages\n(10:43) Toxic femininity versus free speech\n(20:34) Can colleges survive female-led administrations?\n(26:06) Why people with female temperaments feel negative emotion more\n(31:56) Rhetorical fortresses\n(34:59) You don\u2019t need elite schools for an elite education\n(37:52) Genuine accreditation\n(38:41) Do men and woman have the same cognitive ability?\n(40:28) What caused the modern era of cancel culture\n(45:46) Education Reform, Christopher Rufo\n(54:51) Teacher certification and captured research\n(1:00:48) The backlash Rikki has faced as woman\n(1:03:59) Cancel culture thrives on making you feel alone\n(1:06:25) Consequences of honesty, and the rewards\n(1:11:16) The harm in promoting nonsense from the guise of academia\n(1:13:35) Harvard scored below zero on campus freedom of speech\n(1:20:43) How you know a system does not work\n(1:24:09) When colleges promote excellence\u2026\n(1:26:17) Re-education and DEI training\n(1:31:33) The depressing outlook of young people today: censorship, high costs, and debt\n(1:35:58) Social media and zoom behavior during the pandemic\n(1:37:02) Consequences of women growing up in the social media world\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",
