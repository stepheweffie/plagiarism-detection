                "description": "Dr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\nDr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.\n \nDr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar. In 1994, Dr. Hazony founded the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, which became Shalem College in 2013. Being the first liberal arts college in Israel, it attracted widespread attention, followed by much acclaim as many of the country's renowned intellectuals joined its staff. Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education. Other writings by Dr. Hazony have been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Dr. Yoram Hazony:\n\nGet your copy of \u201cConservatism: A Rediscovery\u201d on Amazon:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Conservative-Rediscovery-Yoram-Hazony/dp/1684511097\n\nYoram Hazony\u2019s website: www.YoramHazony.org\n\nLearn more about National Conservatism: www.NatCon.org\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold: \nText \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit \n\nCarZing: \nGet pre-qualified and find the best deals near you: https://carzing.com/jordan\n\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee: \nGet 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/\n\n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(0:54) Intro\n(1:51) Rediscovery\n(3:00) Cultural revolution\n(6:33) Stored cultural capital\n(10:00) Sanity and marxism\n(15:43) Meaning and service\n(22:00) Hierarchy, tyranny, and the tribe\n(31:43) Widespread misconceptions on Conservatism\n(37:36) Mutation, genetic/hierarchical stabilization\n(44:20) Constitutional Axioms, British common law\n(50:50) Redefining the fundamentals\n(57:23) Entropy and Iliad\n(1:00:35) The Flood, myth across culture\n(1:05:25) The call to responsibility, utopian schemes\n(1:10:15) Parenting, shedding adolescence \n(1:13:29) The case for faith,\n(1:17:20) Abraham, the call to adventure\n(1:19:55) To honor those around you\n(1:26:00) Integral liberalism, the lack of filter\n(1:29:45) Common respect, breaking down tribalism\n(1:34:20) The act of judgment\n(1:37:30) Why tilt Conservative?\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",

He has also acquired a second master\u2019s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master\u2019s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as \u201cThe Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.\u201d\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n \n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Mohammed Hijab:\n\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDFNoOk8WOXtHo8DIc8efQ \n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/mohammedhijabofficial/?hl=en \n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/mohammed_hijab?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\nWebsite - www.mohammedhijab.com\n\nThe Sapience Institute - https://sapienceinstitute.org/\n\n\nFor Jonathan Pageau:\n\nCarvings - http://www.pageaucarvings.com \n\nWebsite - www.thesymbolicworld.com \n\nOrthodox Arts Journal - www.orthodoxartsjournal.org \n\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/c/jonathanpageau \n\n- Sponsor - \n\nGet pre-qualified and find the best deals near you: https://carzing.com/jordan \n\n\u2014 Chapters \u2014\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:12) Intro\n(4:16) Addressing \u201cMessage to Muslims\u201d\n(14:35) Colonial amnesia and the pattern of resentment\n(15:19) Egyptian mythology and the bloodshed of the past\n(21:49) Ignoring the voices of disunity\n(27:53) Is there an ultimate purpose to life?\n(35:42) The role of worship and ritual\n(39:52) Unity is not the same as uniformity\n(43:20) Belief at your own peril, deviation, and depression\n(50:55) Islam recognizes Jesus, but not the son of god\n(59:16) We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know\n(1:08:40) Belief in word vs. belief in being\n(1:10:17) Why do we connect with specific scripture?\n(1:23:25) You are measured by how much you can endure\n(1:26:01) Would Jordan Peterson consider becoming Muslim?\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL // \nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.co... \nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate \n\n// COURSES // \nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality \nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com \nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com \n\n// BOOKS // \nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order \n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-... \nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-m... \n\n// LINKS // \nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com \nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events \nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog \n\n// SOCIAL // \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson \nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson \nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #MohammedHijab #JonathanPageau #pageau #islam #muslim #religion",

                "description": "Jonathan Pageau, Douglas Murray, and Dr Jordan B Peterson discuss our hierarchies of perception, existence, faith, and whether meaning is a self evident truth or something intangible that is sought in vain.\n\nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images, and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.\n\nDouglas Murray is a British political commentator and author. In 2007 he founded a think tank called the Center for Social Cohesion, which later became part of the Henry Jackson Society. Currently he is an associate editor for the magazine the Spectator, where he became somewhat infamous after organizing a competition in which entrants were invited to submit offensive poems about Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, with a top prize of \u00a31,000.

                "description": "Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\nJonathan Pageau and Gregg Hurwitz sit down with Dr. Jordan B Peterson to discuss a few of his recent controversial tweets covering topics of transgenderism, the body positivity movement, and the election of supreme court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. In this they seek to explore and debate how Petersons role in society, and thus how he represents himself to the public, can spark or shut down the conversation.\n\nHurwitz is an American novelist, screenwriter, and comic book writer. He is known for authoring the \u201cOrphan X\u201d series, along with a wide range of films such as \u201cThe Book of Henry\u201d (2017) and \u201cThe Rise of Jordan Peterson\u201d (2019).

                "description": "This was the first time that Jonathan Pageau, John Vervaeke, and Jordan Peterson all sat down together in person. Recorded in Dr. Peterson\u2019s home, and prominently featuring many of Kwakwaka\u02bcwakw carver Charles Joseph\u2019s incredible statues and carvings, this recording may require a few complete watch-throughs. The conversation was created to intentionally dive deep into the areas of systems of perception and their impacts on our abilities to prioritize, the nature of YHWH (Judeo-Christian God), and the exploration of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. This conversation is only the beginning of many more conversations to have between these three and on these topics. Please comment any insights that you have derived from this video, my team will be paying close attention to the progress on these ideas.\n\nJonathan Pageau is a symbolic thinker, YouTuber, and class carver of orthodox icons. Jordan and Jonathan have an ongoing dialogue surrounding Judeo-Christian narrative, reality, and symbolism among many other topics.\n\nJohn Vervaeke is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto.

                "description": "Over the last few weeks, we have put together a series entitled \"Meaning, Awe and the Conceptualization of God\" for the Dr Jordan B Peterson Podcast. This series was built around investigating the various methods and practices that humans use to conceptualize God. This investigation leads us down the path of exploring meaning and awe. Why are we struck by awe when viewing a beautiful painting? Why does walking inside the door of a great Cathedral take our breath away? What is the relationship between these experiences and God? \n\nThis compilation includes all 3 parts, as can be found separately wherever you listen to your audio podcasts!\n\nFeatured in this compilation:\n\u00a0@Jonathan Pageau\u00a0 \n\u00a0@John Vervaeke\u00a0 \n\u00a0@Bishop Robert Barron\u00a0 \nStephen Blackwood\nRoland Griffiths\nIain McGilchrist\nStephen Fry\nRandall Wallace\n\u00a0@Word on Fire Institute\u00a0 (Christopher Kaczor and Matthew Petrusek)\n\nThis series was released in three parts on all audio platforms. The series was popular enough for us to make a video version of the series, and we decided to put them all together in one video. \n\nSubscribe to the Jordan B Peterson Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else that you listen to podcasts.\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

All three guests have been on the podcast before, and all share Jordan\u2019s passion for the universal truths of human experience. This deep discussion explores the roots of Meaning and religious significance.\n\nBishop Barron is the founder of Word on Fire and the auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of LA.\n\nJohn Vervaeke is a colleague of Jordan\u2019s and an associate professor at the University of Toronto since 1994. He teaches courses on reasoning, cognitive development, and higher cognitive processes.\n\nJonathan Pageau is a symbolic thinker, YouTuber, and class carver of orthodox icons.\n\n-\n\nFind more Bishop Barron on YouTube:  https://youtube.com/user/wordonfirevideo\nAnd here: https://wordonfire.org/\n\nFind more John Vervaeke online on his website: http://johnvervaeke.com\nJohn's YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/channel/UCpqDUjTsof-kTNpnyWper_Q\n\nFind more Jonathan Pageau on YouTube: https://youtube.com/channel/UCtCTSf3UwRU14nYWr_xm-dQ \nJonathan's website: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\n\n_________\n[00:00] Preview\n[01:30] Intro\n[02:40] Everyone gives their answer to \u201cWhat is meaning?\u201d\n[03:30] \u201cWe're using meaning as a metaphor... something similar to the way a sentence works. It has intelligibility to it that connects us to the world... so that we can interact and be informed by it\u201d Jon Vervaeke\n[07:22] \u201cOur mental framing is transparent like a pair of glasses, but there are times we need to step back and, by taking the glasses off and examining them, consider our framing structure\" JV\n[09:10] \u201cWhen you look at the world there is a central point of focus. When you focus on the point with your eyes it becomes very clear... until we no longer perceive anything by the edge of our vision. It's nothingness, it's just not there\" Jordan Peterson\n[13:56] Bishop Barron's view on meaning and religion\n[14:23] \u201cI would say that meaning is to be in a purposeful relationship to a value\" Bishop Robert Barron\n[17:55] \u201cSo I'm talking to you, which I believe is a good, but it's nested in a higher good and a still higher good, so finally I want not just this particular good but good itself\u2014that's a religious relationship\" BRB\n[18:20] Pageau\u2019s opening thoughts on meaning and religion\n[19:56] \u201cThe reason we perceive hierarchy is because we are always judging... or trying to evaluate whether something\u2019s good\" Pageau\n[20:31] Jordan\u2019s brief foray into \u201cmini-celebrations\u201d\n[21:53] The idea of revelation\n[24:46] \u201cIt isn't obvious to me that we see objects\u2014we see patterns\" JP\n[27:40] \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u2014it wasn't the first song I liked, but it was the first that rocked my world and rearranged my mind, and I think that's where real value is\" BRB\n[28:42] Underlying causes of the crisis of meaning\n[30:10] \u201cSomething that starts with Scotus... and goes into the heart of the scientific revolution is that there\u2019s no such thing as levels\u2014reality just is\" JV\n[31:00] Science around the hierarchy of intelligibility and connectedness\n[33:00] What is science?\n[39:00] \u201cThere\u2019s an epistemic hierarchy and science does not belong on the top\" BRB\n[42:00] \u201cAs scientists, we are motivated by a narrative we don't understand scientifically\u2026 The whole enterprise is driven by a dream whose reality can't be encapsulated within the process itself\" JP\n[44:00] The ignorance in assuming science OR religion are correct\n[44:40] Eminationist ontologies\n[55:30] Religious experiences\n[01:07:30] The book of Revelations as a psychedelic experience.\n[01:17:30] The Psychedelic problem and why psychedelics are useful in communal experiences.\n[01:26:00] Jordan\u2019s biblical lectures\n[01:32:00] What are the guests working on?\n[01:36:00] Beauty in churches\n[01:38:00] Growing up Christian\n[01:44:00] Possibility is real\n[01:50:00] Joining religion and science\n[01:58:04] Wrapping up\n\n#Meaning #Psychology #Religion\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: \nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: \nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: \nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

                "description": "Our friend @JonathanPageau gave a lecture on the conceptual structure of Genesis for an event that was orchestrated by the Montreal Jung Society. Jordan felt that this lecture would serve as a wonderful adjunct to his biblical series, also on Genesis, featured on this channel. \n\nThank you to the Montreal Jung Society and Jonathan for letting us release this video on our channel. We hope that you find it useful. Visit sites.google.com/site/cgjungmontreal for more info on the Montreal Jung Society.\n\nEvent Title: The Symbolic World - a lecture by Jonathan Pageau\n\nEvent Description: \u201cMeaning is showing itself to no longer be an overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality.\n \nThrough the questions of emergence, attention and consciousness which have been permeating so many fields in the recent past, the reality of pattern, ritual and image have also come to the fore. Meaning is showing itself, in a burgeoning post-secular age, as no longer only a subjective overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality itself. In this frame we come to realize that the archetypal truths are not mostly biological and mental constructs in humans; they are firstly the inescapable patterning of the indefinite potential of the world as it encounters intelligence.\u201d \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nInterested in sponsoring my audio podcast?

                "description": "This episode was recorded on October 18th 2021.\n\nMustafa Akyol joins me to discuss Muslim history and tradition. We touch on subjects like Jesus Christ from a Christian and Muslim perspective, the Virgin Mary's role in the Quran, separation of church and state as an ideology, the dangers of literalism when facing religious texts, and much more.\n\nMustafa Akyol is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, where he focuses on the intersection of public policy, Islam, and modernity. He's contributed as an opinion writer for the New York Times since 2013, covering politics and religion in the Muslim world.\n\nPublished by W. W.

He seeks to spread a better understanding of traditionalist Islam while engaging with prominent thinkers and philosophers worldwide.\n\nFind more from Mohammed Hijab on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/mohammed_hijab\n\n[00:00] Intro\n[01:48] What beliefs and practices are central to Islam?\n[04:12] Islam\u2019s unmoved mover argument for God and the universe\n[07:30] \u201cThings made of parts... must be contingent on being created by something else, a sorting mechanism [that] doesn\u2019t necessitate [creation itself].\u201d Mohammed Hijab\n[08:25] \u201cIt is problematic, through the lens of Islam... for there to be a god of a triune nature like [in] Christianity.\u201d MH\n[08:58] \u201cIslam does not believe that there\u2019s an element of divinity... in human beings.\u201d MH\n[10:09] \u201cThe word Islam does not mean peace; it means submission. Islam believes that everything in the universe submits to God.\u201d MH\n[10:57] The metanarrative of Islam\n[12:12] Mohammed\u2019s view of worship and belief\n[12:48] \u201cWe believe in... the inherent belief in God implanted in humans.\u201d MH\n[15:20] What\u2019s the purpose of belief?\n[17:00] The instinct for God arguments vs new atheists\n[18:27] The Muslim ideal for worship, compared\n[24:36] Muslims and Christians as followers of Jesus Christ\n[27:59] How does Dr. Peterson envision the spark of divinity?\n[28:25] \u201cThe divine spark is embodied virtue... reflective of the highest value, operating at a local scale.\u201d JP\n[29:42] How are the attributes of God knowable to a Muslim? The importance of the original version of the Quran\n[35:07] \u201cIslam is an evangelizing religion... we want everyone to embrace it.\u201d MH\n[35:31] Bridges to Islam\n[38:50] \u201cI\u2019m speaking from the perspective of someone who\u2019s a traditionalist Muslim and not a liberal or enlightened Muslim.\u201d MH\n[40:47] An abridged story of the prophet Muhammad. The Mecca and Medina periods. Rationalizing the warrior emphasis of many Muslim teachings\n[44:10] Muhammad\u2019s warrior traits and Hijab\u2019s interpretation\n[49:20] Exploring the terms \u201cwarlord\u201d and \u201cdefensive wars.\u201d\n[50:54] In Hijab\u2019s opinion, what\u2019s the central driving force behind the expansion of Islam?\n[52:10] \u201cIslam has the capability of being expansive through war... and of making peace treaties. It does and should do whatever\u2019s in its best interest, just like every country.\u201d MH\n[55:39] Against totalitarianism\n[58:46] \u201cEvangelising isn\u2019t the same as compelling.\u201d MH\n[58:56] \u201cLet the best story win. I would say that the proper mode of conversion is something like a shining example.\u201d JP\n[01:00:28] M.Hijab on western misconceptions of Islam\n[01:03:20] Other seldom-discussed aspects of Islam\n[01:08:53] M.Hijab\u2019s take on the war in Serbia\n[01:11:05] The economic output of Islamic countries\n[01:15:18] M.Hijab on why the traditionalist view is superior to a liberal one\n[01:21:34] The struggles of belief.

                "description": "Ep. 373\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Andrew Doyle discuss the intentional irrationality of far-left doctrines using religious rhetoric despite the absence of God, their paramount desire to dismantle societal structures, regardless of need or merit, the argument for transcendence inherent in the pursuit of art, and how woke culture stifles genuine expression, forcing dogma in the place of fundamental truths. \n\nAndrew Doyle is a writer, broadcaster and comedian.  His latest book is The New Puritans: How the Religion of Social Justice Captured the Western World.  He is also the author of Free Speech and Why It Matters, and has written two books under the name of his satirical character Titania McGrath \u2013 Woke: A Guide to Social Justice and My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n- Sponsor - \n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit. \n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Andrew Doyle:\n\nThe New Puritans (Book) https://www.amazon.com/New-Puritans-Religion-Justice-Captured-ebook/dp/B09FJL1LFF/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=623199749479&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9013202&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=1165765495605452418&hvtargid=kwd-1658071450267&hydadcr=22569_13493349&keywords=andrew+doyle+the+new+puritans&qid=1688643112&sr=8-1 \n\nAndrew on Twitter @AndrewDoyle_com https://twitter.com/andrewdoyle_com \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:25) Intro\n(1:49) Do \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d wing mean anything anymore?\n(4:27) Activists or caricatures?\n(5:49) Left wing authoritarianism\n(12:55) Hitler\u2019s temperament, everyone pays\n(13:37) The spirit of Cain\n(17:21) All the hallmarks of a fundamentalist religion\n(20:35) Lens of presuppositions, in the place of God\n(25:24) Milton\u2019s Satan, power claims\n(28:47) Querying society, emotionality and whim\n(35:20) Teaching students to protest, the infantile world\n(38:10) Where does the left go too far?\n(44:05) Outsourced thinking\n(45:20) Dawkins, the aftermath of the death of God\n(50:00) Why the \u201cwoke\u201d movement appeals to academics\n(52:08) Do the arts move us toward a unitary spirit?\n(58:54) No great art has come out of the social justice movement\n(59:45) Balancing the need to survive with honest expression\n(1:04:36) An artist must submit to their muse\n(1:05:29) Most people are not great artists, functional hacks\n(1:06:26) Sacrificing the ideal, theorists of resentment\n(1:10:08) Losing the point of Shakespeare, the power of Macbeth\n(1:13:44) The greatest form of tragedy, why the Passion is so impactful\n(1:16:11) Harrowing hell, realizing our own malevolence\n(1:20:18) The refusal of understanding\n(1:24:03) When you bring the margin to the center, the snake that eats its own tail\n(1:27:40) Sex reassignment is an affront to the gay community\n(1:31:28) Gender ideologies have taken control\n(1:34:07) The unnecessary expansion of Pride\n(1:35:50) This is a spiritual battle at its core\n(1:38:04) Kids pushing back through parody?

                "description": "Ep. 372\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson discusses the new film \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d with star Jim Caviezel and real life inspiration Tim Ballard. The film details Ballard\u2019s work as a Special Agent to fight against sex trafficking and the child sex trade. They go into depth on the psychology of pedophilia, the nature of good and evil, and how a steady faith in God has guided all three.\n\nTim Ballard is the founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.), which locates and rescues endangered children victimized by sex trafficking rings.  Previously, he accrued a decade of experience as a Special Agent in the Dept. of Homeland Security, working as an undercover op for the U.S. Child Sex Tourism Jump Team.\n\nJim Caviezel is a prominent American actor and household name in no small part for his portrayal of Jesus Christ in \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d (sequel coming in 2024). He has had a decades long career both on and off screen, and is an advocate for faith in the modern world.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Hallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor \"Sound of Freedom\"\n\nWebsite & Showtimes https://www.angel.com/tickets/sound-of-freedom?variation=july_3&gclid=CjwKCAjw44mlBhAQEiwAqP3eVnIIADwWMUdV6MjV99Y3Zw2oyCtO0W8OFgNZM7-M6SYBGjxqo7ABqhoCXlAQAvD_BwE&zip=49090&date=2023-07-03 \n\n\nFor Tim Ballard: \n\nO.U.R Website https://ourrescue.org/about-us?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw44mlBhAQEiwAqP3eVqV_6rYPxwLItz-4eRgxqml0g6rQo_nxKsMRxsU_nLFlaGJlnzLQIBoC-WYQAvD_BwE \n\nTwitter @TimBallard https://twitter.com/TimBallard \n\n\nFor Jim Caviezel:\n\nTwitter @JimmyCaviezel https://twitter.com/jimmycaviezel?lang=ar\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:34) Intro\n(2:43) The magnitude of the modern slave trade\n(6:31) Addressing criticism\n(9:23) Organ and blood trade\n(12:17) Slate and dishonest journalism\n(15:36) Why Jim Caviezel joined \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d cast\n(18:33) Schindler\u2019s List, making the film now instead of 50 years too late\n(21:49) Particularizing the problem\n(22:45) The real story they based the film on\n(26:45) How Tim Ballard became a Special Agent\n(30:00) What you deal with when assigned to a child sex crimes unit\n(33:17) Tragedy and malevolence, the need for a moral narrative\n(37:33) Cain and Able, the two pathways to adaptation\n(40:10) Psychology of pedophilia, progressing the fantasy\n(44:21) The face of evil is not always obvious\n(49:07) How the monsters justify themselves\n(51:01) How Jim studied for the role, the Unabomber\n(54:50) You don\u2019t go to the devil to play the devil\n(56:04) Milton\u2019s Satan, characterizing evil\n(58:35) Truth and good through scripture\n(59:43) The Shroud of Turin\n(1:00:33) The black holes that actors enter for their work\n(1:02:03) More people are afraid of the Devil then they are of God\n(1:04:40) To become as a child, innocence in the face of evil\n(1:08:17) The Passion is an archetypal story, decent and rebirth\n(1:10:38) When you face your maker, the paths you choose to take\n(1:14:03) The reason people lie, and what happens when you tell the truth\n(1:16:40) The price for truth, sacrificing security\n(1:19:21) When the new path clears, opportunity and reward\n(1:23:45) Tony Robbins, connections that change the world\n(1:25:12) Why Tim Ballard won\u2019t be silenced, spiritual warfare\n(1:27:22) Chloe Cole\n(1:29:04) The next chapter, sequels in the works\n(1:30:00) Fighting for theaters\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

                "description": "Ep. 382\n\nDr. Jordan B Peterson and breakout musician Chris Lunsford, better known by his stage name Oliver Anthony, discuss the balance between vision and efficiency in artistic and commercial endeavors, why Chris\u2019 hit song \u201cRich Men North of Richmond,\u201d has resonated so broadly and so quickly, the way honest expression through music can combat demoralization, how politics have become confused with the sacred, and what we can do to restore each to their proper order.\n\nOliver Anthony, real name Christopher Anthony Lunsford, is an American country/folk musician from Farmville, Virginia. He just recently went viral for his anthem song, \u201cRich Men North of Richmond\u201d \u2013 which has resonated across the country for its messaging about Washington D.C. and the state of poverty and mental health in the broader U.S.. Chris has stated his politics as being right down or near the center, though already tribalism has attempted to take hold of or alternatively reduce/dismiss him, all the while \u201cRich Men\u201d has amassed nearly 60 million views on YT in just over a month, and trended the billboard charts (Hitting number one more than once) since its release. Chris named his YT channel Oliver Anthony Music after his grandfather, whom he has described as a \u201creal 1930\u2019s Appalachian man.\u201d Since his song's virality, he has already been offered \u2013 and turned down \u2013 an 8 million dollar recording contract, and is making waves as a truly authentic artist both in performance and practice.\n\nJordan\u2019s Spotify country song playlist: https://spotify.link/p6lLiWmOVCb\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nPreBorn: Help save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Oliver Anthony:\n\nOliver Anthony Music (Website) https://oliveranthonymusic.com/ \n\nOliver Anthony Music (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/@oliveranthonymusic \n\n\u201cRich Men North of Richmond\u201d original release https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro\n\n\nPlaylists, selfauthoring and understandmyself:\n\nWestern blues: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/045isSJ13hV5IdUZDerZn8?si=1pFnvZgUR4WokUw38FfBNg\n\nRomance: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tbyhvDLvwvmtVCG0fzuaf?si=Hg4zNHEZRw6l_dDyfRADXQ\n\nClassic Rock: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4C0ULawC4R1qLF5YHrsDwH?si=L_Vq6wpTTqOcVhqrjd0-iA\n\nTom Waits etc: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5T7ifFAUptSVlDRlQQReVi?si=66mHsTf9QqKNM7eG03TEHA\n\nhttps://selfauthoring.com/\n\nhttps://understandmyself.com/\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:34) Intro\n(1:31) Collecting country music\n(6:31) Classical music, how music resonates with us\n(8:20) What about \u201cRich Men North of Richmond\u201d caused it to go so viral?\n(12:15) The ideology behind \u201cselling out\u201d\n(15:37) Turning down 8 million dollars, what really matters\n(19:01) The personal impact of touching on people\u2019s hardship\n(21:04) Advice for living in the public sphere\n(24:54) The sacred has collapsed into the profane: meaning and performance\n(28:02) The best music is often written in the worst of times\n(32:38) The establishment media has become irrelevant, choosing the right partners\n(40:20) Staying at the personal level\n(41:40) Dr. Peterson\u2019s friend Chris, how the story impacted Oliver\n(44:36) The importance of humility, meet & greets, speaking to the individual\n(49:28) The weight of hopelessness, the loss of common ground\n(54:33) Self improvement in the public eye, bridging what you lack with the people you need\n(57:41) Oliver Anthony on his personal use of the Self Authoring and Understand Myself programs\n(1:04:01) Where there is no vision, people perish\n(1:06:27) The retail dystopian nightmare America has become\n(1:09:13) Oliver on convincing his wife to live in the woods\n(1:11:00) How scripture has parallels across our lives\n(1:13:19) When Moses noticed the burning bush, investigate what calls to you\n(1:17:02) Taking in the last few weeks: family, vision, and play\n(1:19:54) Where to place your faith, staving off the ease of bitterness\n(1:23:42) Republicans and Democrats: where we are right now\n(1:27:47) Why God must be placed at the highest\n(1:31:16) When you start to think about the future\n(1:35:18) False urgency and the justification of fear\n(1:36:36) Appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience\n(1:38:00) Last minute gig at the Comedy Mothership\n(1:39:16) Why we trust Joe Rogan\n(1:40:57) Philosopher Man\n(1:42:16) The world has a dream like quality to it\u2026 so dream\n(1:43:02) ARC and shaping a positive vision for the world\u2019s future\n(1:47:25) Everything we do echoes\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n#TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",

                "description": "Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with mathematician, author, and theologian Dr. John Lennox. They discuss the axioms and dangerous aims of transhumanism, the interplay between ethical faith, reason, and the empirical world that makes up the scientific endeavor, and the line between luciferian intellectual presumption and wise courageous exploration.\n\nDr. John Carson Lennox is a \u200b\u200bNorthern Irish mathematician, bioethicist, and Christian apologist. He has written several books, and was a professor at Oxford and Green Templeton College (Now retired) where he specialized in group theory. Lennox appeared in numerous debates with questions ranging from \u201cIs God Good\u201d to \u201cIs There a God,\u201d and faced off with academic titans such as Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer, and Christopher Hitchens, among others. Lennox speaks four languages \u2013 English, German, French, and Russian, has written 70 peer-reviewed articles on mathematics, co-authored two Oxford Mathematical Monographs, and was noted for his role in translating Russian mathematics while working as a professor. \n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nEp.394\n\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Dr. John Lennox:\n\nWebsite https://www.johnlennox.org/ \n\nThe Oxford Center For Christian Apologetics https://www.theocca.org/  \n\nThe Veritas Forum https://www.veritas.org/ \n\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:33) Intro\n(1:19) The \u201cunbridgeable gap\u201d between science and Christianity\n(5:46) Is the human soul a microcosm of the cosmos?\n(10:01) Evidence of a Creator, a \u201cword-based universe\u201d\n(15:01) Truth exists\n(18:03) Statistical analysis, the ethical dimension of science\n(23:41) Prioritization of facts is done through ethics\n(26:18) Thought and time: from where does the revelation spring?\n(33:23) Transhumanism: an extension of demented protestantism\n(37:18) The death of God, the death of man\n(43:28) The weight of being, the problem of physical death\n(46:37) You cannot breed for evolutionary fitness\n(50:24) Third Wave Biology, Questioning Darwin\n(52:59) The wisdom not to cross the line\n(59:27) Knowing good and evil vs. defining it as subjective\n(1:02:04) The three sources of moral knowledge\n(1:04:03) The basis for human dignity\n(1:09:48) Sacrifice and maturity\n(1:15:17) The female crucifixion\n(1:18:18) Death is not the end\n(1:19:51) Voluntary exposure to build strength\n(1:24:34) Lazarus, leaving the darkness\n\n\n// LINKS //\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",

                "description": "Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with historian and author Niall Ferguson. They discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent of world-ending narratives, how the global doomsday ethos abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class, the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today, and how we might strive to deal with genuine tragedy morally, religiously, and with humility.\n\nNiall Ferguson is a Scottish-American historian, author, columnist, TV presenter, and academic. He is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, as well as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.

                "description": "Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in person with Dr. John Vervaeke. They discuss the relationship between your calling and your conscience, the three dimensions of the sacred, how Descartes' famous \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d conclusion might be restructured in modern day, what exactly Socrates\u2019s Daemon was, and the bridging of morality and meaning.\n\nJohn Vervaeke is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. His work constructs a bridge between science and spirituality in order to understand the experience of meaningfulness and the cultivation of wisdom so as to afford awakening from the meaning crisis.\n\nThis episode was recorded on January 8th, 2024\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp \n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan \n\n\n- Links -\n\n\n2024 tour details can be found here - https://jordanbpeterson.com/events  \n\nPeterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/ \n\n\nFor Dr. John Vervaeke:\n\nYoutube Channel https://www.youtube.com/user/johnvervaeke \n\nAfter Socrates (Series) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOwjmZx12gk&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuj6q5NP_fXjBzUT1p_qYSCC \n\nThe Vervaeke Foundation https://vervaekefoundation.org/ \n\n\u201cZombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis\u201d (book) https://www.amazon.com/Zombies-Western-Culture-Twenty-First-Century/dp/1783743298 \n\n\"Mentoring the Machines: Orientation - Part One: Surviving the Deep Impact of the Artificially Intelligent Tomorrow\" (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Mentoring-Machines-Orientation-Artificially-Intelligent/dp/1645010821/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1705353143&refinements=p_27%3AJohn+Vervaeke&s=books&sr=1-2&text=John+Vervaeke \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:25) Intro\n(1:42) 2024 plans, The Philosophical Silk Road\n(5:33) The Vervaeke Foundation\n(6:44) Cataloguing John\u2019s body of work, AI\n(9:02) Mentoring the Machine\n(10:35) Staying virtuously oriented\n(13:40) Entropy, perceptions, assumptions, and the sacred\n(16:30) Hyper priors, indexing social standing for the proportionality of response to negative stimuli\n(18:35) The divine lies deeper, calling and conscience\n(23:30) Three dimensions of the sacred\n(26:16) There is either a unity or a plurality\n(27:30) \u201cThe One\u201d grounds out in effability \n(28:56) Love comes from a feeling of \u201crealness\u201d\n(30:00) Healing and the Gospels\n(31:33) Piaget, Descartes, systems of insight\n(34:54) Thought is a form of secularized prayer\n(41:07) Nothing within or without\n(43:45) Humility and resolution\n(45:16) The landscape of the soul, parallels to Dante\u2019s Inferno\n(48:00) Idolatry, using hurt to smite pretensions\n(49:41) Conscience and the ineffable\n(54:11) Vervaeke\u2019s Daemons\n(57:32) The appearance of Hermes, transjective presence\n(59:48) Embracing the relationship\n(1:05:06) The eye at the top of the pyramid,\n(1:09:48) When a text is inevitably transformative\n(1:14:52) Sacred but not the One, searching for ultimacy\n(1:19:36) A metaphysical concern with evil\n(1:21:50) Plato\u2019s pivot problem\n(1:25:02) Job\u2019s proposition\n(1:27:36) Joe Versus the Volcano\n(1:30:09) Why we disassociate from meaning, morality, and being\n(1:32:31) For love or duty, morality and ethics\n(1:36:37) Restoration of the religio without traditional organization\n\n\n// LINKS //\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nTour Locations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nX: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",
