In this lecture, I describe what I consider to be the idea of God, which is at least partly the notion of sovereignty and power, divorced from any concrete sovereign or particular, individual person of power. I also suggest that God, as Father, is something akin to the spirit or pattern inherent in the human hierarchy of authority, which is based in turn on the dominance hierarchies characterizing animals. \n\nQ & A Starts: 1:57:25\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

In this lecture, I present Genesis 1, which presents the idea that a pre-existent cognitive structure (God the Father) uses the Logos, the Christian Word, the Second Person of the Trinity, to generate habitable order out of pre-cosmogonic chaos at the beginning of time. It is in that Image that Man and Woman are created -- indicating, perhaps, that it is (1) through speech that we participate in the creation of the cosmos of experience and (2) that what true speech creates is good. \n\nIt is a predicate of Western culture that each individual partakes in some manner in the divine. This is the true significance of consciousness, which has a world-creating aspect. \n\nQ & A Starts: 1:59:00\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-p...\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation). I didn't mind, because it is very important to get God and the Creation of the Universe right before moving on  :)  .\n\nIn this lecture, I tried to outline something like this: for anything to be, there has to be a substrate (call it a potential) from which it emerges, a structure that provides the possibility of imposing order on that substrate, and the act of ordering, itself. So the first is something like the precosmogonic chaos (implicitly feminine); the second, God the Father; the third, what the Christian West has portrayed as the Son (the Word of Truth). \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

In its few short paragraphs, it covers:\n\n1. the emergence of human self-consciousness; \n2. mankind's attendant realization of vulnerability, mortality, and death; \n3. the origin of the capacity for willful evil, as the ability to exploit that newly-realized vulnerability;\n4. the emergence of shame as a consequence of that realization;\n5. the shrinking from divine destiny that occurred when shame emerged; and\n6. the beginning of true history, with the self-conscious toil that life in history entails.\n\nImpossible. Amazing. Breathtaking. \n\nThe only story that can perhaps match it in terms of impact per sentence is that of Cain and Abel, which we discuss in the next lecture: number five in this twelve part series. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

                "description": "Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6\n\nBible Series V: Cain and Abel: The Hostile Brothers\n\nThe account of Cain and Abel is remarkable for its unique combination of brevity and depth. In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. \n\nCain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.\n\nAbel's mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain's malevolence.\n\nThis great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

This is a more elaborated tale than the initial creation account, or the story of Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel. However, it cannot be understood in its true depth without some investigation into what the motif of the flood means, psychologically, and an analysis of how that motif is informed by the order/chaos dichotomy, as well as by the idea of an involuntary voyage to the underworld or confrontation with the dragon. In consequence, this lecture concentrates almost exclusively on psychology: How is an encounter with the unknown to be understood, conceptually? How and why is that represented with themes such as the underworld voyage, the dragon fight, or the flood? \n\nAll that constitutes the theme of lecture VI.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

This stark truth finds its narrative representation in the widely-distributed universal motif of the flood. Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, noted that flood stories identify two reasons for the destruction: (1) the tendency of complex things to fall apart of their own accord; (2) the proclivity of human beings to speed up that process by sinning, or missing the mark (by engaging in self-evident corruption, or by failing to attend to what cries out for attention). The Genesis story clearly states that Noah and his family are to be spared from impending disaster because Noah \u201cwalks with God,\u201d as Adam did before the Fall. In this lecture, the 7th in the series, I intermingle the story of Noah and his survival with elements of the Sermon on the Mount, making the effort to explain to a modern audience why careful moral attitude and behavior comprises the best defence against \u201cthe righteous anger of God.\u201d \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

The history of Israel proper begins with these stories. Abram heeds the call to adventure, journeys courageously away from his country and family into the foreign and unknown, encounters the disasters of nature and the tyranny of mankind and maintains his relationship with the God who has sent him forth.  He becomes in this manner a light in the world, and a father of nations. \nHow is this all to be understood? I am attempting in this lecture to determine precisely that. How are we, as modern people, to make sense of the idea of the God who reveals himself to a personality? How can we relate the details of the Abramic stories to our own lives, in the current world? In what frame of reference can these stories be seen to make sense, and to reveal their meaning? \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

I did so as part of the background research I was doing for the 8th lecture in my series The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories. We talked about the nature of the narrative landscape of the Bible, focusing on the Abrahamic stories, which constitute the subject material for that 8th and other forthcoming lectures.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

The man portrayed in the Bible as the father of nations moves forward into the world. He encounters the worst of nature (famine), society (the tyranny of Egypt) and the envy of the powerful, who desire his wife. There is nothing easy about Abraham's life. Instead, he is portrayed both as a real man, with serious problems, and a hero, who overcomes tremendous obstacles to establish himself in the world.\n\nHis covenant with God is an Ark. His decision to aim at the highest good he can conceptualize places an aura of magic around the events of his life, despite their harshness. He's a model for life in the world as it is, not as we wish it would be.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Abraham's life is presented as a series of encapsulated narratives, punctuated by sacrifice, and the rekindling of his covenant with God. This seems to reflect the pattern of human life: the journey towards a goal, or destination, and the completion of a stage or epoch of life, followed by the necessity of revaluation and reconsideration of identity, prior to the next step forward. Abraham, for his part, makes the sacrifices necessary to continue to walk with God, or before God (as the terminology in this section has it). It is this decision that allows him to transcend the vicissitudes of life, and to take his role as the father of nations. \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-p...\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

The denizens of Lot\u2019s soon-to-be lost cities threaten them with violent rape. God exacts a terrible retribution.

What, then, should best be sacrificed? And what might be the greatest gain? There are few eternal questions more profound and difficult.\n\nIn this lecture, I read an excerpt from Chapter 7 of my new book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, now available for pre-order at Amazon.ca (http://amzn.to/2wkb7MY) and Amazon.com (http://amzn.to/2x1hfXF). \n\nI am currently making arrangements to continue this series with a monthly lecture. That will start in September at a date and time yet to be announced. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

In it, I present the story of Joseph who, as the wearer of the coat of many colors, is profoundly adaptable, courageous, adaptable, merciful and just. Even in slavery -- even in prison -- he comes out triumphant, because of the strength of his character and his wisdom. Betrayed by his brothers, he acts to strengthen his family; unjustly accused by the Pharaoh's wife, he maintains his faith. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",

It can be thought of as part of the structure of narrative that sits at the basis of our culture. It includes elements of sacrifice (associated with delay of gratification and the discovery of the future) and psychological transformation (as movement forward in life often requires the death of something old and the birth of something new). \n\nThis five-part commentary is an attempt to explain such ideas in detail so that they can be understood, as well as \u201cbelieved.\u201d  \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson",
